        I design successful responsive websites that are quick to load, simple
        to navigate, and constructed using industry best practises. Front-end
        development, HTML, CSS, JS, building small and medium web apps,
        features, animations, and coding interactive layouts are my major areas
        of expertise.

        I'd be delighted to hear from you. Whether it's a project, an internship
        opportunity, or just a conversation. Please do not hesitate to contact
        me.
